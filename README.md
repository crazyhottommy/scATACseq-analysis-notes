# scATAC-seq-analysis-notes
my notes for scATACseq analysis


### paper to read


* [Single-cell transcriptomics in cancer: computational challenges and opportunities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-020-0422-0) by Jean, Kamil and Fan.
* review [Single-cell ATAC sequencing analysis: From data preprocessing to hypothesis generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020303019)
* [Prospective, brain-wide labeling of neuronal subclasses with enhancer-driven AAVs](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/20/525014?rss=1) Neuroscientists need ever-more specific methods to restrict expression of tools to defined neuronal subpopulations. This amazing study from @AllenInstitute uses scATAC-seq & scRNA-seq to discover enhancers that are even more specific than driver lines.

### ATAC-seq QC

### protocols 

[An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5623106/)

#### Fragment length distribution

A blog post by [Xi Chen](https://dbrg77.wordpress.com/2017/02/10/atac-seq-insert-size-plotting/)

>The successful construction of a ATAC library requires a proper pair of Tn5 transposase cutting events at the ends of DNA. In the nucleosome-free open chromatin regions, many molecules of Tn5 can kick in and chop the DNA into small pieces; around nucleosome-occupied regions, Tn5 can only access the linker regions. Therefore, in a normal ATAC-seq library, you should expect to see a sharp peak at the <100 bp region (open chromatin), and a peak at ~200bp region (mono-nucleosome), and other larger peaks (multi-nucleosomes)

>there might be some artifact with how the aligner deals with fragments where the forward read and reverse read are exact reverse complements of each other. I know that Bowtie (1 but not 2) has some issue with those reads.

### ATAC-seq

>Some may notice that the peaks produced look both like peaks produced from the TF ChIP-seq pipeline as well as the histone ChIP-seq pipeline. This is intentional, as ATAC-seq data looks both like TF data (narrow peaks of signal) as well as histone data (broader regions of openness).

* [Brockman](https://carldeboer.github.io/brockman.html) is a suite of command line tools and R functions to convert genomics data into DNA k-mer words representing the regions associated with a chromatin mark, and then analyzing these k-mer sets to see how samples differ from each other. This approach is primarily intended for **single cell** genomics data, and was tested most extensively on single cell ATAC-seq data
* [Reproducible inference of transcription factor footprints in ATAC-seq and DNase-seq datasets via protocol-specific bias modeling](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/19/284364)
* [msCentipede](http://rajanil.github.io/msCentipede/) is an algorithm for accurately inferring transcription factor binding sites using chromatin accessibility data (Dnase-seq, ATAC-seq) and is written in Python2.x and Cython.
* The Differential ATAC-seq Toolkit [(DAStk)](https://biof-git.colorado.edu/dowelllab/DAStk) is a set of scripts to aid analyzing differential ATAC-Seq data.
* [Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites using ATAC-seq](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/17/362863)  We propose HINT-ATAC, a footprinting method that addresses ATAC- seq specific protocol artifacts
* [HMMRATAC](https://github.com/LiuLabUB/HMMRATAC) splits a **single** ATAC-seq dataset into nucleosome-free and nucleosome-enriched signals, learns the unique chromatin structure around accessible regions, and then predicts accessible regions across the entire genome. We show that HMMRATAC outperforms the popular peak-calling algorithms on published human and mouse ATAC-seq datasets.
* [ChromA](https://github.com/marianogabitto/ChromA): Chromatin Landscape Annotation Tool. 
ChromA is a probabilistic model to annotate chromatin regions into accessible or inaccessible, open or closed, based on their ATACseq profile. ChromA can process bulk datasets, single-cell or integrate information from a combination of both. Even more, ChromA can integrate information from different replicates or different cellular populations to create a consensus representation of chromatin accessibility.

### peak calling

* [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/issues/145)

> --shift -100 --extsize 200 will amplify the 'cutting sites' enrichment from ATAC-seq data. So in the end, the 'peak' is where Tn5 transposase likes to attack. The fact is that, although many information such as the insertion length and the other mate alignment is ignored, such result is still usable. Especially when the short fragment population is extremely dominant, the final output won't be off much.

```bash
macs2 --nomodel --keepdup all --shift -100 --extsize 200
macs2 -f BAMPE
```
